Public XML-exchange of web domain WHOIS-properties

2022-01-26:
My purpose is to communicate Whois to public in a readable way.

Note: The XML file contains data from two domains, which makes Excel open properly.

See also https://webhostingtech.nl for design. See for example output https://whois.hostingtool.nl/WhoisForPublic/.
