- Whois properties of a web domain could be more accessible;
- Business transparency must be combined with privacy of a natural person;
- Better public understanding clears up workload for registrars;
- The name and contact details of the holder matter for customer protection, manageable administrative workload and for an 'In Control Statement' (ICS).

The global discussion can, I think, proceed by country along with modeling of non-centralized server communications in XML. For the increasing number of top-level domains, a database per continent can indicate the Whois server name of a registry, plus the zone related conditions. A server of the RIPE organization could fit.
