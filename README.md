- WHOIS properties of a web domain could be more accessible;
- Business transparency needs to be combined with privacy of a natural person;
- Better public understanding clears up workload for registrars;
- The name and contact details of the holder matter for customer protection, manageable administrative workload and for an 'In Control Statement' (ICS);
- Legal structure arises after narrowing down physical structure.

The global discussion can, I think, proceed by country along with modeling of non-centralized server communications in XML. For the increasing number of top-level domains, a database per continent can indicate the WHOIS server name of a top-level zone, plus the other static zone values. Servers of the RIPE organization could fit. My modeled XML zone file can contain all top-level data for download once a day.

Note: The XML files contain data from two domains. So Excel can check XML syntax.
