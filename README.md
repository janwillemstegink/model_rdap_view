- Web domain information can become informative for outsiders;
- Business transparency must be combined with privacy of a natural person;
- Better public understanding clears up workload for registrars;
- Interfaces can recognize ‘Personal private use’, ‘Personal public use’ and ‘Business use';
- The name and contact details of the holder matter for customer protection, manageable administrative workload and an 'In Control Statement' (ICS);
- Legal structure for Whois can arise after narrowing down physical structure first.

Discussing globally can, I think, proceed by country along with modeling of non-centralized server communications. For the increasing number of top-level domains, a database per continent can indicate the Whois server name of a top-level zone plus other static values. Servers of the RIPE organization could fit. My zone file is modeled to contain the necessary top-level data for download once a day.
