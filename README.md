Currently, the Whois properties of a web domain are not sufficiently accessible. Public misunderstanding causes considerable work for registrars. The holder's name and contact details are relevant for customer protection, manageable administrative workload and for an 'In Control Statement' (ICS). The global discussion can, I think, proceed by country along with modeling of non-centralized server communications in XML. For the increasing number of top-level domains, a database per continent can indicate the Whois server name of a registry.
