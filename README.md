Currently, the Whois properties of a web domain are not sufficiently accessible. The holder's name and contact details are relevant for customer protection, manageable administrative workload and an 'In Control Statement' (ICS). The global discussion can, I think, proceed by country along with modeling of non-centralized server communications in XML. A regional resource could lead to a Whois server name of the increasing number of top-level domains.
